  <purpose>
    <item>Design and audit shape language with usability-first constraints.</item>
    <item>Evaluate placement and geometry effects on clarity and action discoverability.</item>

  <safety>
    <rule>Treat shape meaning as directional tendency, not deterministic truth.</rule>
    <rule>Do not rely on shape alone for critical feedback.</rule>
    <rule>Do not substitute symbolism for usability.</rule>

  <semantic_defaults>
    <shape type="rounded">approachability and continuity</shape>
    <shape type="rectangular">stability and reliability</shape>
    <shape type="angled">direction and urgency</shape>
    <rule>Use one dominant family with one accent family.</rule>

    <step order="1">Define focus path: entry, action, confirmation.</step>
